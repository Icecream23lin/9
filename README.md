# Automated Reporting and Insight Generation tool

### Developed by: 25T2-9900-W10A-DONUT

In this project, we will build an automated reporting and insight generation 
system.

Specifically, an internal project that will be used at UNSW (University of New 
South Wales). A typical UNSW department spends 10~15 hours monthly on manual 
data cleaning and report consolidation.

This project aims to build a lightweight, Python based desktop application to automate spreadsheet ingestion, data cleaning, KPI 
calculation, PDF report generation, and automated email delivery, ultimately reducing 
human involvement while improving report consistency, insight quality, and processing 
efficiency.

### DEV
To run desktop app run the following command in root folder

    npm install

    cd frontend && npm install

    cd ../ && npm run dev


This command starts frontend and deploys in port 5173, spawns python backend
