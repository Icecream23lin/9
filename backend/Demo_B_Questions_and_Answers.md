# Demo B - WIL Data Analysis System: Potential Tutor Questions & Answers

## üß† Product Design & Architecture Questions

### Q1: How does your system architecture solve the core problem of WIL program analysis?

**Answer:**
Our system addresses the challenge of analyzing complex WIL (Work Integrated Learning) participation data through a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Data Quality Focus**: Universities often have messy, inconsistent data across years. Our validation and cleaning pipeline handles missing values, data type inconsistencies, and structural differences between datasets.

2. **Multi-Year Analysis**: Unlike simple reporting tools, we specifically designed for year-over-year comparison - essential for understanding program growth and trends.

3. **Non-Technical User Focus**: We generate AI-powered insights and professional PDFs, making complex data accessible to administrators, faculty, and stakeholders without data science expertise.

**Architecture Benefits:**
- Modular Flask blueprint design allows easy feature addition
- Service layer separation enables testing and maintenance
- Async processing with status tracking handles large datasets without timeouts

### Q2: Why did you choose this specific technology stack, and what alternatives did you consider?

**Answer:**
**Core Stack Decisions:**

- **Flask over Django**: Flask's lightweight nature suits our API-focused architecture. Django's ORM would be overkill since we primarily process CSV files rather than complex relational data.

- **Pandas over Raw SQL**: WIL data comes in various CSV formats. Pandas provides excellent data manipulation capabilities and handles the messiness of real-world educational data better than SQL alone.

- **Matplotlib over Chart.js**: We need high-resolution (300 DPI) charts suitable for professional reports and publications. Server-side generation ensures consistent quality across different browsers.

- **FLAN-T5 over GPT-3/4**: FLAN-T5 runs locally, ensuring data privacy (critical for student data), costs nothing per request, and provides consistent results for report generation.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Considered Django but rejected due to complexity overhead
- Evaluated Plotly but chose matplotlib for PDF integration
- Considered OpenAI API but rejected due to cost and data privacy concerns

### Q3: Explain your data processing pipeline design decisions.

**Answer:**
We designed a 4-stage pipeline based on real-world data challenges:

**Stage 1 - Upload & Validation:**
- Problem: Universities provide data in different formats/structures
- Solution: Smart column detection, data type inference, quality scoring
- Design Decision: Fail fast with detailed error messages rather than attempting to process bad data

**Stage 2 - Data Cleaning:**
- Problem: Missing values, inconsistent formatting, encoding issues
- Solution: Configurable cleaning strategies (fill vs preserve NaN)
- Design Decision: Always preserve original data and create cleaned copies

**Stage 3 - Analysis & Visualization:**
- Problem: Stakeholders need insights, not raw statistics
- Solution: Automated chart generation with professional styling
- Design Decision: Generate multiple chart types to tell a complete story

**Stage 4 - Report Generation:**
- Problem: Non-technical users need digestible reports
- Solution: AI-generated narratives with embedded visualizations
- Design Decision: Focus on latest year trends while showing historical context

## ‚öôÔ∏è Product Features & Implementation Questions

### Q4: Walk me through how your multi-year analysis feature works technically.

**Answer:**
**Multi-Year Analysis Flow:**

1. **Data Alignment**: Different years may have different column structures (e.g., 2024 lacks GENDER column, 2025 has it)
   ```python
   # Smart merging handles missing columns gracefully
   merged_df = pd.concat(all_dataframes, ignore_index=True)
   ```

2. **Latest Year Priority**: For key insights, we prioritize the most recent year's data:
   ```python
   def get_latest_year_data(self):
       latest_year = sorted(self.data['ACADEMIC_YEAR'].unique())[-1]
       return self.data[self.data['ACADEMIC_YEAR'] == latest_year]
   ```

3. **Duplicate Handling**: Remove duplicates based on student ID and academic year:
   ```python
   merged_df = merged_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['MASKED_ID', 'ACADEMIC_YEAR'])
   ```

4. **Comparative Visualization**: Generate side-by-side enrollment charts showing year-over-year changes

**Key Design Decision**: We focus insights on the latest year (where data is most complete) while using historical data for comparison context.

### Q5: How does your AI-powered insight generation work?

**Answer:**
**NLP Integration Architecture:**

1. **Model Choice**: FLAN-T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) for consistent, privacy-preserving local inference
2. **Data-Driven Prompts**: We extract key metrics and feed structured data to the model:
   ```python
   insights = f"WIL program in {latest_year} has {total_students} students across {faculties} faculties..."
   trend_text = model.generate(insights, max_length=200, num_beams=4)
   ```

3. **Context-Aware Generation**: Different prompts for single-year vs multi-year analysis
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: If AI generation fails, we provide template-based insights

**Business Value**: Transforms raw statistics into executive-ready narratives that highlight key trends and recommendations.

### Q6: How do you handle data quality and validation?

**Answer:**
**Multi-Layer Validation System:**

**Layer 1 - File Structure Validation:**
- Column existence checking (required fields like ACADEMIC_YEAR, MASKED_ID)
- Data type inference and validation
- Encoding detection and handling

**Layer 2 - Business Logic Validation:**
- Academic year ranges (reasonable values like 2020-2030)
- Student ID format consistency
- Faculty code validation against known values

**Layer 3 - Data Quality Scoring:**
```python
quality_score = {
    'missing_data_percentage': missing_pct,
    'duplicate_records': duplicate_count,
    'outlier_detection': outlier_pct,
    'overall_score': calculated_score
}
```

**Layer 4 - Cross-File Consistency (Multi-Year):**
- Student tracking across years
- Faculty code consistency
- Data structure evolution validation

### Q7: What's your strategy for handling large datasets and performance?

**Answer:**
**Performance Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Chunked Processing**: For large files, we process data in chunks to manage memory
2. **Async Operations**: Long-running analysis operations are asynchronous with status tracking
3. **Efficient Chart Generation**: We generate charts once and reuse them across different outputs
4. **Smart Caching**: Analysis results are cached and reused for report generation

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Current system handles ~50,000 student records efficiently
- Database-like operations using pandas indexing
- Memory management for multiple simultaneous analyses

**Load Testing Results**: Successfully processed 30,000 student records across 3 years in under 60 seconds.

### Q8: How do you ensure cross-platform compatibility (especially Windows)?

**Answer:**
**Cross-Platform Challenge**: 
We encountered Windows encoding issues with Unicode characters in logging output.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced all emoji characters (üîç, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå) with ASCII text ("DEBUG", "SUCCESS:", "ERROR:")
- Ensures compatibility with Windows command prompt encoding (cp1252)
- Maintained logging clarity while avoiding charset issues

**File Path Handling**: Used `os.path.join()` throughout for Windows/Unix path compatibility

**Testing Strategy**: Team members test on both Windows and macOS to catch platform-specific issues early.

### Q9: How do you handle sensitive student data and privacy?

**Answer:**
**Privacy-By-Design Approach:**

1. **Local Processing**: All AI processing happens locally using FLAN-T5, no external API calls
2. **Data Masking**: Student IDs are masked (`MASKED_ID` field) in the input data
3. **Temporary Storage**: Uploaded files are stored temporarily and can be configured for auto-deletion
4. **No Data Persistence**: We don't permanently store student data - analysis results and visualizations only

**Security Measures:**
- Filename sanitization to prevent directory traversal
- File type validation to prevent malicious uploads
- Secure temporary directory handling with UUID-based naming

### Q10: What client feedback have you incorporated, and how?

**Solution - Smart Column Detection:**
```python
if 'GENDER' in latest_year_data.columns:
    # Use latest year gender data for insights
    gender_data = latest_year_data[latest_year_data['GENDER'].notna()]
else:
    # Graceful fallback with clear messaging
    summary["gender_breakdown"] = {"Not Available": {"count": 0, "percentage": 0.0}}
```

**Adaptive Processing:**
- Detect available columns per year
- Use most complete dataset for primary insights
